Q)Find the maximum number in any of three variables.

Start
print "please write 3 numbers"
input num1,num2,num3
if 	(num1 > num2) AND (num1 > num3)
   	print "num1 is greatest"
	end
Elseif 	(num2 > num1) AND (num2 > num3)
   	print "num2 is greatest"
	end
Elseif 	(num3 > num1) AND (num3 > num2)
   	print "num3 is greatest"
	end


Q) Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator (Use your head for this)

Start
print "please write 3 numbers"
input num1,num2,num3
sum = num1 ADD num2 ADD num3
print sum
end

Q) Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)

Start
print "please write 2 numbers *Note if the numbers are not same then your bigger number should be num1*"
input num1,num2
print "do you wanna add or subtract these numbers? type "+" for addition or "-" for subtraction"
input operator
if	operator == +
	sum = num1 + num2
	print sum
	add
Elseif	operator == -
	difference = num1 - num2
	print difference
end
