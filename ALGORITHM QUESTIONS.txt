ALGORITHM QUESTIONS

Q) Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

ask user for 2 numbers where n is the number to be divided and Nth is the number which we will use to divide n
use modulus operator between n and Nth and check the remainder
if the remainder is 0 then Nth is the divisor of n
also if only the remainder is 0 
use modulus operator again but this time between n and 2
if the remainder is still 0 then the number is even
else the number is odd


Q) Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.

set 1 for January
set 2 for February
set 3 for march
set 4 for April
set 5 for May
set 6 for June
set 7 for July
set 8 for august
set 9 for September
set 10 for October
set 11 for November
set 12 for December
ask user for a number from 1 to 12
check the input number
if the number matches the one in data then print its respective month
else ask user to input another number between 1 to 12

Q) Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

set + for addition
set - for subtraction
set * for multiplication
set / for division
set % for remainder
ask user for 2 numbers
ask user for the operation to do on that number
apply the following operation on the numbers
display the results to the user
